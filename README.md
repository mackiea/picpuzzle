WDEF sample program
===================

This sample program serves several purposes.

1. It shows how to write a basic classic Mac application with windows, menus and desk accessories.
2. It shows how to write a very primitive custom window definition (WDEF).
3. It shows how to compile a WDEF (or a similar code resource) and include it in an application.
4. It shows how to avoid 3. and include the window definition procedure directly in the application.
