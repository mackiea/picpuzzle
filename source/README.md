HOW TO PLAY
===========
WHen you start a new game, you will see a blank playfield with grey squares. The grey colour indicates that the squares colour has not yet been determined.

On the top and left, there is a series of numbers. The numbers on the left are hints that indicate the run or runs of consecutive black squares in their row. For example, a "hint" of "5 3" mans that this row has a run of 5 black squares, and another run of 3 black squares. The runs will be separated by at least 1 white square.

On the top, the numbers indicate the number and length of runs in their columns.
